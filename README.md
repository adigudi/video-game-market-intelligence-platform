🎮 Video Game Market Intelligence Platform

A Full-Stack Data Analytics Project (SQL · Python · C++ · Tableau)

---

📌 Overview

This project analyzes 16 years of global video game sales, reviews, ratings, and genre performance to help publishers make data-driven decisions about which games to create and which markets to target. The final system combines SQL data engineering, Python analytics, a custom C++ clustering engine, and Tableau dashboards to deliver clear insights and strategic recommendations.

This README is a starter version and will expand as the project develops.

---

🚀 Project Goals
- Build an end-to-end analytics pipeline from raw CSV data to interactive dashboards
- Clean, transform, and model video game sales data in SQL
- Use Python for KPI analysis, statistical testing, and feature engineering
- Implement a C++ clustering module for performance-optimized computation
- Visualize market insights and launch recommendations in Tableau
- Produce a polished, portfolio-ready project demonstrating full-stack analytical skills

🧱 Planned Architecture

This project will be structured as a layered analytics stack:

TABLEAU DASHBOARDS  → Stakeholder-facing insights  
C++ ENGINE          → Fast clustering & segmentation  
PYTHON ANALYTICS    → KPIs, A/B tests, feature engineering  
SQL DATABASE & ETL  → Data cleaning, loading, querying  
RAW DATA (CSV)      → Source dataset

📁 Repository Structure (Initial)

├── data/          # Raw and cleaned datasets  
├── sql/           # Schema, ETL scripts, analytical SQL queries  
├── python/        # EDA, clustering, statistical tests, integration scripts  
├── cpp/           # C++ clustering engine source code  
├── tableau/       # Tableau workbooks and data extracts  
└── reports/       # Visualizations and executive summaries  

This structure will evolve as more components are completed.
